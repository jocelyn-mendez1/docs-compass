*New in version 1.14.0*

The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in |compass| provides the ability to
create :manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to
process data. In aggregation pipelines, documents in a collection
or view pass through stages where |compass| processes them into a
set of aggregated results. You can change the stages and results to
suit your needs.

To start building an aggregation pipeline for a :doc:`collection or view
</collections>`, choose the collection and click the
:guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
A blank aggregation pipeline displays. The :guilabel:`Preview of
Documents in the Collection` section of the :guilabel:`Aggregations`
view displays 20 documents sampled from the current collection.

You can:

- :ref:`Create a new aggregation pipeline <create-agg-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Save a pipeline <save-agg-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Open a saved pipeline <open-saved-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Set the documents limit or auto preview documents <use-sample-mode-or-auto-preview>`

- :ref:`View or change pipeline settings <change-pipeline-settings>`

- :ref:`Specify custom collation <pipeline-custom-collation>`

- :ref:`Create a view from pipeline results <create-a-view>`

- :ref:`Import a pipeline from plain text <compass-import-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Export a pipeline to Java, Node, C#, and Python 3 <compass-export-pipeline>`

Limitations
-----------

The :pipeline:`$out` stage is not available if you are connected to a
`Data Lake <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/data-lake>`__.

#. In the modal, click :guilabel:`Open Pipeline`.

.. note::

   Starting in |compass| 1.31, you can view your saved queries
   and aggregation pipelines on the :guilabel:`My Queries` view 
   once connected to your cluster.

   :ref:`viewing saved aggregations<saved-query-view>` for details.

.. _use-sample-mode-or-auto-preview:

Set the Documents Limit or Auto Preview Documents
-------------------------------------------------

Use the toggles at the top of the pipeline builder to set the
limit on the number of sampled documents or to enable auto preview.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - .. data:: Sample Mode
     - (*Recommended*) When enabled, limits input documents passed to
       :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$bucket`, and
       :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stages. Set the document limit with the
       :data:`Limit` setting.

   * - .. data:: Auto Preview
     - When enabled, |compass-short| automatically updates the
       preview documents pane to reflect the results of each active
       stage as the pipeline progresses.

.. _change-pipeline-settings:

View or Change Pipeline Settings
--------------------------------

To view and change pipeline settings:

1. Click the gear icon at the upper right of the pipeline builder to
   open the :guilabel:`Settings` panel.

#. Change any of the following pipeline settings.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70 30

      * - Option
        - Description
        - Default
      * - .. data:: Comment Mode
        - When enabled, adds helper comments to each stage.
        - Enabled
      * - .. data:: Number of Preview Documents
        - Number of documents to show in the preview.
        - 20
      * - .. data:: Limit
        - When :guilabel:`Sample Mode` is enabled, specifies the number of
          documents passed to :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$bucket`, and
          :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stages. Lower limits improve pipeline
          running time, but may miss documents.
        - 100000

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to save changes and close the
   :guilabel:`Settings` panel.

.. _pipeline-custom-collation:

Specify Custom Collation
------------------------

Use :manual:`custom collation </reference/collation/>` to specify
language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for
letter case and accent marks.

To specify a custom collation:

#. Click :guilabel:`More Options` in the top right corner of the pipeline 
   builder. 

   .. figure:: /images/compass/options-collation.png
        :alt: Collation Option

#. Enter your collation document.

.. _create-a-view:

Create a View from Pipeline Results
-----------------------------------
   
.. note::

   Creating a view from pipeline results does not save the pipeline
   itself.

To create a view from your pipeline results:

.. include:: /includes/fact-create-view-from-pipeline.rst

Example
-------

In this example, you create and run a pipeline
for a collection with airline data. You can download this
dataset from the following link:
`air_airlines.json <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/compass/air_airlines.json>`__.

For instructions on importing JSON data into your cluster, see
:manual:`mongoimport </reference/program/mongoimport/>`. This
example assumes you have the data in the
``example.air_airlines`` namespace.


Create the Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following pipeline has two aggregation stages:
:pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$match`.

- The ``$group`` stage groups documents by their
  ``active`` status and ``country``. The stage also adds
  a new ``flightCount`` field containing the number
  of documents in each group.

- The ``$match`` stage filters documents to return documents
  with a ``flightCount`` value greater than or equal to ``5``.

Copy the Pipeline to the Clipboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click the :guilabel:`Export to Language` button at the top
   of the pipeline builder. The following page displays:

   .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-example-export-to-node.png
      :alt: Aggregation Builder Full Example

#. Click the :guilabel:`Copy` button in the :guilabel:`My Pipeline`
   panel on the left. |compass-short| copies the pipeline to your
   clipboard in :binary:`~mongo` shell syntax. You will use the
   pipeline in the following section.

Run the Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Launch and connect to a
   :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` instance which contains the imported ``air_airlines.json`` dataset.
   
#. Switch to the ``example`` database where the ``air_airlines``
   collection exists:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use example

#. Run the following command to run the pipeline created in
   |compass-short|:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.air_airlines.aggregate([{
        $group: {
          _id: {
            active: '$active',
            country: '$country'
          },
          flightCount: {
            $sum: 1
          }
        }
      }, {
        $match: {
          flightCount: {
            $gte: 5
          }
        }
      }])

The pipeline returns documents, as shown in the following abbreviated example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : { "active" : "Y", "country" : "Nigeria" }, "flightCount" : 5 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Switzerland" }, "flightCount" : 46 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Bahrain" }, "flightCount" : 8 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Guinea-Bissau" }, "flightCount" : 8 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Argentina" }, "flightCount" : 14 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Moldova" }, "flightCount" : 17 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "Y", "country" : "Israel" }, "flightCount" : 6 }
   { "_id" : { "active" : "N", "country" : "Finland" }, "flightCount" : 7 }
