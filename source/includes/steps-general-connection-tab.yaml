  .. procedure::
  
     .. step:: Select a Connection String Scheme.

        You can select one of the following options:

        .. list-table::
           :header-rows: 1
           :class: border-table

           * - Connection String Scheme
             - Definition

           * - mongodb
             - :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/>`. 
               The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to 
               connect to a MongoDB deployment: standalone, replica set, or a sharded 
               cluster. 

           * - mongodb+srv 
             - :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format </reference/>`. The ``+srv`` 
               indicates to |compass| that the hostname that follows corresponds to a 
               :manual:`DNS SRV record </reference/connection-string/>`.

     .. step:: Enter a Hostname.

        In the :guilabel:`Host` field, enter the hostname of the server where the 
        deployment is running.

        If you are running your deployment locally, this value is ``localhost``. 
        If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, you can get your hostname 
        from your :atlas:`cluster detail view 
        </tutorial/view-all-clusters/#view-cluster-details>` in Atlas.

        If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database 
        Administrator for information.

     .. step:: Enable Direct Connection. 

        When you use the ``mongodb`` Connection String Scheme, you have the 
        option to enable a :driver:`Direct Connection 
        </node/current/fundamentals/connection/#direct-connection>`. When you 
        enable this setting, Compass runs all operations on the specified host.

        When you specify directConnection and connect to a secondary member of 
        a replica set, your write operations fail because it is not the primary 
        member.
