Encryption (FLE). |compass-short| displays the values of these fields
as a series of asterisks.

collection is configured with :v6.0:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>`, 
you can enable and disable the :guilabel:`Queryable Encryption` connection 
option. 

- When :guilabel:`Queryable Encryption` is enabled, you can modify and view 
  the encrypted values and fields.

- When :guilabel:`Queryable Encryption` is disabled, |compass-short| displays the 
  values of these fields as a series of asterisks.
