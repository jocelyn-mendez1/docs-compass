You can save a pipeline so that you can find it later. If you
load a saved pipeline, you can change it without
changing the original saved copy. You can also create a :ref:`view
<view-details>` from your pipeline results.

To save your pipeline:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the save dropdown button

      Click the :guilabel:`Save` dropdown button at the top of the pipeline
      builder. Click on ``Save pipeline as...``

      .. figure:: /images/compass/query-save-pipeline-as.png
         :alt: Save pipeline as

   .. step:: Enter a name for your pipeline

      .. figure:: /images/compass/query-save-pipeline-as-name.png
         :alt: Name your pipeline

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`
