load a saved pipeline, you can change it without
changing the original saved copy. You can also create a :ref:`view
<view-details>` from your pipeline results.

To save your pipeline:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Save` dropdown button.

      Click on ``Save pipeline as...``.
<<<<<<< HEAD

   .. step:: Enter a name for your pipeline.
