:manual:`Time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` efficiently 
store sequences of measurements over a period of time. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

      From the :guilabel:`Collections` screen, click the 
      :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

   .. step:: Enter the collection name.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Options` dropdown.

      Check the :guilabel:`Time Series Collection` option.

   .. step:: Specify a :guilabel:`timeField`.

      Specify which field should be used as the ``timeField`` for the time-series 
      collection. This field must have a :manual:`BSON type date </reference/bson-types/>`.

      The following fields are optional:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``metaField``
           - The name of the field which contains metadata in each time series 
             document. The metadata in the specified field should be data that 
             is used to label a unique series of documents. 

         * - ``granularity``
           - The ``granularity`` field allows specifying a coarser granularity so 
             measurements over a longer time span can be more efficiently stored 
             and queried.

             The default value is set to ``seconds``.

         * - ``expireAfterSeconds``
           -  The ``expireAfterSeconds`` field enables automatic deletion of 
              documents older than the specified number of seconds.  

      For more information on time series fields, see 
      :manual:`Time Series Collections </core/timeseries-collections/>`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Collection` to create the collection.

      Your collection will be marked by a :guilabel:`time series` badge. On the 
      left-hand navigation bar your time series collection will have the 
      following icon:
