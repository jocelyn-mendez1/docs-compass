Restrictions and Limitations
----------------------------

The following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a 
capped collection:

- You can only use :guilabel:`custom collation` along side your capped 
  collection from the :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Options`. 

- If you import a data set larger than the maximum size of the capped collection,
  |compass-short| will only load the part of the data set that is within the 
  size range. 

- Once the collection is created, you cannot adjust the maximum number of bytes.
