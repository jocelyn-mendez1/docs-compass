   In-Use Encryption is an Enterprise/Atlas only feature. 

The :guilabel:`In-Use Encryption` connection tab allows you to connect your 
deployments using :manual:`Queryable Encryption
</core/queryable-encryption/>`. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/advanced-connection-options.png
         :figwidth: 690px
         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`In-Use Encryption` tab.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Provide a :guilabel:`Key Vault Namespace`.

            A :guilabel:`Key Vault Namespace` refers to a collection that 
            contains all the data keys used for encryption and decryption. 

            Specify a collection in which data encryption keys are stored in 
            the format ``<db>.<collection>``.

         .. step:: Select a :guilabel:`KMS Provider`.

            You can select from the following Key Management Systems: 

            - :ref:`Local KMS <local-kms>`
            
            - :ref:`AWS <aws-compass-encryption>`
            
            - :ref:`GCP <gcp-compass-encryption>`
            
            - :ref:`Azure <azure-compass-encryption>`
            
            - :ref:`KMIP <kmip-compass-encryption>`

            .. _local-kms:

            Local KMS
            ~~~~~~~~~

            You can locally manage your key as a KMS using the :guilabel:`Local KMS`
            option.  

            Click :guilabel:`Generate Random Key` to generate a 96-byte long 
            base64-encoded string. You need this key to access encrypted data.

            .. warning::

               |compass-short| does not save KMS credentials by default. Copy 
               and save the key in an external location.
