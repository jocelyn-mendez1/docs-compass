      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Select a Connection String Scheme.

            You can select from the following two options:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :class: border-table

               * - Connection String Scheme
                 - Definition

               * - mongodb
                 - :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/>`. 
                   The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to 
                   connect to a MongoDB deployment: standalone, replica set, or a sharded 
                   cluster. 

               * - mongodb+srv 
                 - DNS Seed List Connection Format. The +srv indicates to the client that 
                    the hostname that follows corresponds to a 
                    :manual:`DNS SRV record </reference/connection-string/>`.

         .. step:: Enter a Hostname.

            Hostname of the machine where the deployment is running.

            If you are running your deployment locally, this value is localhost. 
            If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, you can get your hostname 
            from your cluster detail view in Atlas.

            If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database 
            Administrator for information.

         .. step:: Enable Direct Connection. 

            When you use the ``mongodb`` Connection String Scheme, you have the 
            option to enable a :guilabel:`Direct Connection`. This specifies 
            whether to force dispatch all operations to the specified host.

   .. step:: See the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

      You can provide additional connection configurations. 

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Connect`.
