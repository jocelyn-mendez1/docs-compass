The :guilabel:`General` connection tab allows you to select a 
:guilabel:`Connection String Scheme` for your |compass-short| deployment. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`General` tab.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Select a Connection String Scheme.

            You can select one of the following options:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :class: border-table

               * - Connection String Scheme
                 - Definition

               * - mongodb
                 - :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/>`. 
                   The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to 
                   connect to a MongoDB deployment: standalone, replica set, or a sharded 
                   cluster. 

               * - mongodb+srv 
                 - :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format </reference/>`. The ``+srv`` 
                   indicates to |compass| that the hostname that follows corresponds to a 
                   :manual:`DNS SRV record </reference/connection-string/>`.

         .. step:: Enter a Hostname.

            In the :guilabel:`Host` field, enter the hostname of the server where the 
            deployment is running.

            If you are running your deployment locally, this value is ``localhost``. 
            If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, you can get your hostname 
            from your :atlas:`cluster detail view 
            </tutorial/view-all-clusters/#view-cluster-details>` in Atlas.

            If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database 
            Administrator for information.

         .. step:: Enable Direct Connection. 

            When you use the ``mongodb`` Connection String Scheme, you have the 
            option to enable a :driver:`Direct Connection 
            </node/current/fundamentals/connection/#direct-connection>`. When you 
            enable this setting, Compass runs all operations on the specified host.

            When you specify directConnection and connect to a secondary member of 
            a replica set, your write operations fail because it is not the primary 
            member.

   .. step:: For more configuration options, see the 
             :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

      You can specify additional connection configurations under the 
      :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.

   To disconnect your deployment, see :ref:`<disconnect-tab>`.
