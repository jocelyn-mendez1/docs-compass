The :guilabel:`Advanced` connection tab provides additional connection options 
for your deployment. These options can be used alongside the 
:ref:`<general-connection-tab>`, :ref:`<authentication-connection-tab>`, 
:ref:`<tls-ssl-tab>`, and :ref:`<ssh-connection>` connection options. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

         :figwidth: 690px
         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab.

      Select a :guilabel:`Read Preference` from the following options:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50 

         * - Read Preference
           - Description

         * - primary
           - Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set primary.

         * - primaryPreferred
           - In most situations, operations read from the primary but if it is 
             unavailable, operations read from secondary members. 

         * - secondary
           - All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.

         * - secondaryPreferred
           - In most situations, operations read from secondary members but if 
             no secondary members are available, operations read from the primary 
             on sharded clusters.

         * - nearest
           - Operations read from a random eligible replica set member, 
             irrespective of whether that member is a primary or secondary, based 
             on a specified latency threshold. The operation considers the following 
             when calculating latency:

             - The localThresholdMS connection string option
             - The maxStalenessSeconds read preference option
             - Any specified tag sets
